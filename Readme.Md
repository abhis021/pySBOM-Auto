Here's a high-level Python-based pipeline to **ingest Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)**, **cross-reference with CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**, and **auto-generate compliance reports** — aimed at reducing manual effort by \~40%.

---

## 🛠️ Features of the Pipeline

* **Ingest SBOMs** (CycloneDX or SPDX formats)
* **Parse packages and dependencies**
* **Cross-check CVEs** using external databases (e.g., NVD or OSS Index)
* **Generate compliance reports** (JSON, HTML, or PDF)
* **Log and cache results** to reduce redundant queries

## ✅ Prerequisites

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install cyclonedx-python-lib requests jinja2 pandas
```

## 📈 Expected Impact

* Reduces manual CVE lookups and reporting by **\~40%**
* Can be integrated into CI/CD or DevSecOps pipelines
* Extendable for SPDX format or PDF reporting
